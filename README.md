# GM networking system v1.0.0

TCP. UDP. You want it? It's your my friend. As long as you have enough bandwidth.

This system is intended to simplify creating client/server netcode in GameMaker. 

It may change as I use it and think of more features.

Made in GameMaker v2024.6.1.208, so should be compatible with modern versions.

## How do i get it

You can download the project files with the demo, and the .yymps (just [the script](https://github.com/Antidissmist/gm_networking_system/blob/main/scripts/scr_networking_system/scr_networking_system.gml)) in the [Releases](https://github.com/Antidissmist/gm_networking_system/releases) tab.

(Using [MultiClient](https://github.com/tabularelf/MultiClient) and [ImGui_GM](https://github.com/nommiin/ImGui_GM))

## Quick Setup

### server-side:
```js
//create event
server = new net_server(port,max_players);
server.start();

server.on("hello",function(data,from_client){
    show_debug_message("hello, " + data.message); //hello, world!
});

//async networking event
server.on_async_networking();
//cleanup event
server.cleanup();
```

### client-side:
```js
//create event
client = new net_client();
client.connect(ip,port);

client.send("hello",{ message: "world!" });

//async networking event
client.on_async_networking();
//cleanup event
client.cleanup();
```

## Features


```js
//send data (TCP)
server.send(client,"event",data);
client.send("event",data);

//send data (UDP)
server.send_udp(client,"event",data);
client.send_udp("event",data);

//send to all clients, given a condition
server.send(NET_ALL_CLIENTS,"event",data,filter_function);

//request data and get a response
server.request(client,"event")
    .on_response(function(response,from_client){ })
    //optional:
    .on_error(function(data){ }) //data: { type: "timeout" }
    .on_finally(function(){ })
client.request("event") //same as above
    .on_response(function(response){ })

//close connection
server.stop();
client.disconnect();
```
You can send anything JSON-able like a struct, array or just a value.

Broadcast over LAN:
```js
//server create event:
server.get_lan_server_info = function() {
    //add any relevant info like name, number of players, etc.
    return { name: "cool server" };
};
//anywhere:
server.broadcast_to_lan(true); //starts broadcasting server ip & info over LAN
```
Client-side (in like a multiplayer menu) look for LAN games to join:
```js
//create event:
listener = new net_lan_listener();
//async networking event:
listener.on_async_networking();
//cleanup event:
listener.cleanup();

/*
At some point listener.server_array will look something like this:
[
    {
        ip: "127.0.0.1",
        server_port: 6510,
        compatible: true,
        version: 1,
        info: { name: "cool server" }
    },
    etc...
]
*/
```
Some more things to know about:
```js
server_or_client.on(NET_EVENTS.packet_failed); //sending a packet failed multiple times, maybe quit to menu
//client:
client.on(NET_EVENTS.connected,func); //we can start sending gameplay related stuff
client.on(NET_EVENTS.disconnected,func); //lost connection or kicked, quit to menu
client.on(NET_EVENTS.connect_failed,func); //failed trying to connect to server, quit to menu?
client.is_connected //boolean
client.is_connecting //bolean; "waiting for server..."
client.uuid //a unique string you can tell clients apart with.
//server methods:
server.on_client_connected = function(client){}; //"player joined the game!"
server.on_client_disconnected = function(client){}; //"player left the game!"
server.is_open //boolean
server.clients_foreach(function(client,index){});
server.client_kick(client,reason_string);
```
